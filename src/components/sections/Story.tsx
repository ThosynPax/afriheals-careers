                            <p>
                                There's no large team or faceless process here, just deep expertise, focused execution,
                                and a track record of helping founders go from idea to product with clarity and speed.
                            </p>
                            
                            <p>
                                After years of working on startups and digital products, I noticed a pattern: 
                                Founders often get stuck at the starting line, full of vision, but lacking the support, 
                                direction, or product strategy to get moving.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                So, I created <span className="font-bold text-indigo-600">The Pax Company</span>, where I combine UX engineering, product design,
                                and lean technology to help you build smarter MVPs, validated PoCs, 
                                and growth-ready websites, fast, focused, and AI-enhanced.
